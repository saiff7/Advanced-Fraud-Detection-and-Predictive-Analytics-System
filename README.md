# Data-Analysis-and-Modeling-Tasks

This repository contains solutions to three analytical problems using fictional datasets. Below are the details of each task:  

Part One: Exploratory Analysis  
Dataset: `task1_transport_data.csv`  
This dataset contains information about the number of orders made by customers of a fictional transportation company, along with additional variables.  

Objectives:  
1. Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in the data.  
2. Summarize the insights with visualizations and tabular representations.  
3. Develop predictive models to estimate the number of jobs completed by the company on any given day.  
4. Identify significant and insignificant factors affecting the number of jobs completed, providing detailed explanations of the model's performance and observations.  

Part Two: Network Analysis  
Dataset: `task2_customers_devices_cards.csv`  
This dataset includes information about fraudulent users of a smartphone app used for payments. Each record links a user, device, and credit card.  

Objectives:  
1. Detect networks within the dataset and provide clear visualizations of the identified networks.  
2. Hypothesize two distinct types of fraudulent behaviors based on the network analysis.

Part Three: Location Analysis  
Dataset: `task3_fraudulent_orders_locations.csv`  
This dataset consists of a month's worth of fraudulent orders from a fictional e-commerce company.  

Objectives:  
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns in the dataset.  
2. Determine where the fraud detection team should focus their efforts.  
3. Identify the worst hotspot for fraud in terms of:  
   - Number of orders.  
   - Combined order values.  
4. Highlight any limitations of the dataset and how they might impact the analysis.
